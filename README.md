## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn. Python version: 3.7.12

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interested in using Airbnb Open Data from 2016 to understand:
1.	What type of property listing has the highest price? 
2.	Which months of the year are the busiest? 
3.	Which review criteria contribute the most to overall review ratings?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

+ project1_seattle-airbnb_v2.ipynb : notebook with code and plots for the analysis

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found in this [Medium post](link).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
The dataset was sourced from AirBnB provided through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?resource=download). Some of the functions used in the code were taken from exercises as part of the Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree 2022.
